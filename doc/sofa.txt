SOFA - Super Optimsed Fast Assembler
====================================

(c) Copyright Peter Campbell Software 1988-1994

SOFA is an 8088 (and semi-80386) assembler. The syntax is based lightly on
A86 and CHASM (two other shareware assemblers).

SOFA comes with full assembler source code that gives an idea of the syntax
used by SOFA (very raw and simple compared with MASM).

SOFA can also assemble itself - sofa sofa;

Sofa's features include quick assembly time (thousands of lines per second),
conditional compilation, include files and many more.

If you are familiar with 8088 assembly language then you will be able
to understand more of sofa's features by view the source code.

Another program written in assembly language (FAST.COM) is provided
in shareware. Fast is another computer language similar to Basic, Pascal
and C. Fast provides users with the speed and power of assembly language
without using the low level functions.
