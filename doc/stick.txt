STICK: PC-PC Communications
===========================

(c) Peter Campbell Software 1994.

3rd October 1994.


Stick communications is designed for support personnel to connect to client
computers using MODEMs at 9600+.

The client computer must run "STICKR" - once this has loaded the support
person may dial into the computer using their MODEM with "STICK".


The syntax for STICK is "STICK phone_number".
Record commonly used phone numbers in a menu program (such as fbmenu).

When a connection is made a popup box appears on the client's computer
saying a support person has connected. Both the support person and the
client can use the keyboard to talk to the running application.

The support person can do anything the client can do via the keyboard.

Any DOS application can be run (provided in text mode).

When the support person wishes to disconnect they press Ctrl-Shift-Escape
(left hand of the keyboard). A popup box tells the client the connection
has been terminated.

Further support for different MODEM configurations and other applications
can be provided upon request.
