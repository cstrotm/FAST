I received your fax regarding the TSR program to detect files in Novell.

There are several points which are causing you problems:

The find first command must not be in the 'on int' section, this should
be in a program procedure similar to that in my TSR.F skeleton file.

Example:

proc program
    {
    using=1
    activate=0
    old_psp=psp:psp reg cs	    ; <<<< IMPORTANT

    ;find first here etc

    psp old_psp
    using=0
    }

;== Main entry =============================================================

activate=0  ;Currently not trying.
on int 1
    {
    if ((peek 0|417h) and 3)=3 then activate=1
    if activate and (inds[indo]b=0) then program
    }


The find first fails because the program segment prefix and other items
have not been setup - these commands must be processed before running
any DOS commands - simply checking the INDOS flag is not enough.

PS: also for accuracy check the INDOS flag before using the 'timer'
function - this is a BIOS function but may not be re-entrant and could
also cause problems.

Instead of using 'timer', have your own variable, use it this way...

    counter = 0

    on int 1
	{
	;check indos[]
	counter++
	if counter>(18*8) then
	    {
	    ;check file

	    counter=0
	    }
	}

This also removes the potential problem when the timer resets to 0 at the
end of each day - your program would stop working.
