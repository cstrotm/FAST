VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS
====================
~var *= n    Multiplies var by n, storing result in var.
~var ++      Increments var (by 1), storing result in var.
~var += n    Adds n to var, storing result in var.
~var --      Decrements var (by 1), storing result in var.
~var -= n    Subtracts n from var, storing result in var.
~var /= n    Divides var by n, storing result in var.
~var = n     Gives var the value of n.
~var @ n     Gives the variable a new address in memory (the default address
            is somewhere after the FAST code).

Note ! A variables address must be set before the variable is used anywhere.
     ! n must be a constant.
