FBMENU - FastBase Menu Program (for use with any programs/options)
======

(c) Copyright Peter Campbell Software 1993, 1994

Introduction
------------

FBMENU is designed as an easy to use reliable menu system.

FBMENU's advantages over other menu programs include:
    - small memory requirements (10-12K)
    - easy to use script 'language'
    - multi user
    - security features

FBMENU will work with any DOS programs that can be executed from the command
line (including Windows). Some time delay backup systems will cause problems
because they do not relinquish control to FBMENU for display and input.

Setup
-----

The file FBMENU.M must be in the current directory where ever the FBMENU
program is executed from.

If installing FBMENU on a single user DOS machine then include FBMENU.COM and
FBMENU.M in the root directory.

If installing FBMENU on a network then include the FBMENU.COM and FBMENU.M
files in the user's login directory (or \LOGIN if using one directory).

The command "FBMENU n" must be included in the autoexec.bat file to load
the menu program. This command must be in the user or system login script
on a network as "#FBMENU n".

"n" represents the security level for the user using this menu.
A level below 9 will disable the ESC key (no access to DOS).

To control security levels on a network the following code could be
implemented into the login script for all users:

    IF "%GROUP%" = "SALES" THEN #FBMENU 1
    IF "%GROUP%" = "ADMIN" THEN #FBMENU 3
    IF "%GROUP%" = "SUPER" THEN #FBMENU 9

Once FBMENU has been loaded into a computer the menu file is active and cannot
be changed - regardless if another user has logged in or the fbmenu.m file
has changed.

For security reasons it is best to manually check the user group or user name
before allowing special functions.

Script Definition
-----------------

The fbmenu.m script language uses the first letter of each line as a command,
the sequence of a script file usually takes the following format:

header options:

    T	<title>
    F	<function key>

menu options:

    M	<menu>
    I	<item>

process options:

    D	<dos command>
    S	<sub menu>
    G	<get input>
    X	<exit>


The first part of the menu file must always define the title and function
keys (both are optional).

Title
-----

The default title is "(c) The FastBase Development Company Ltd".
This is printed in the top part of the screen.

If the first line of the script file starts with a capital "T" then the
rest of the line is assumed to be the title.

eg: TFastBase Development Company

Function Keys
-------------

The line at the bottom will show all available function keys.
If you define function keys then define them in order (ie: the first
function key definition is F1, F2, F3 etc).

Function keys can have the same process options as menus - this includes
"D" for DOS commands, "S" for sub menus, "G" for getting input and "X" to
exit. See the MENU option for more details.

eg: FDOS	    <F1:DOS>
      DCLS	    <dos command: cls>
      X 	    <exit to DOS prompt>

    FXTG	    <F2:XTG>
      DCD\XTGOLD    <change directory>
      DXTG	    <execute XTG>


The following sections in the script file describe the individual menus,
menus are numbered from 0 to 999 - in order of definition.

Menus
-----

A menu is defined with a title and items - each item can have process
options for DOS, sub menus, getting input and exiting.
Menus can have an optional colour code.

A menu item has an optional security level, name and process options.

eg: MApplications Menu		<menu name: Applications Menu>
      IAccounting System	  <item: Accounting System>
	DF:			    <change to F drive>
	DCD\FBASE		    <change to FBASE directory>
	DFBM			    <run FastBase>
      IWordPerfect		  <item: WordPerfect>
	DF:			    <change to F drive>
	DCD\WP51		    <change to WP51 directory>
	DWP51			    <run WordPerfect>
      I3,Network Functions	  <item: Network Functions, security 3+ only>
	S1			    <display sub menu number 1>

The "D" DOS command option is used to perform any DOS command.
This option can also be used with programs which require input besides DOS
including programs like DEBUG.
The command is executed exactly as if it was manually entered.

When a menu item is selected no assumptions can be made about which drive
or directory is current.

The "S" sub menu option will display the menu number specified, the menu will
always appear slightly overlapping the previous menu. Pressing the ESC key
always returns to the previous menu.

The "G" get command allows input from the keyboard for parsing parameters to
DOS commands.

eg: IDirectory		    <item: Directory>
      G1,Drive? A,B,C	      <prompt: Drive? A,B,C>
      DDIR %1:		      <dos directory, eg: DIR B:>
      DPAUSE		      <pause after directory>

The first parameter after the "G" is the maximum length of input allowed,
this is physically set to 50 but there is no default - a length must be
specified.

If more than one input is required then specify several "G" lines.
Each subsequent "G" will represent the DOS parameter %1, %2, %3 etc.

The "X" exit option returns the user to the DOS prompt.
To return to FBMENU type "FBMENU". To simplify this rename or copy FBMENU.COM
to a shorter name eg: "MENU.COM" or "M.COM".


Screen Saver
------------

The screen saver will appear automatically after 10 minutes.
To manually start the screen saver press ALT-S.

The messages that appear are randomly based on pre-formatted words, nouns
and adjectives. There is a version of the menu floating around with rude
messages (please advise if you have this version and it can be replaced with
the more sedate version).


Terminating FBMENU
------------------

If you have started FBMENU but the script file is wrong you can abort the
running version of fbmenu and re-load it after making your changes.

This option only applies if fbmenu was started with level 9 security.
Press ALT-X at the main menu (menu 0).


Colour Codes
------------

The colour codes for the menu are made up as follows:

    Background*16 + [8 for bright] + Foreground

0 = Black
1 = Blue
2 = Green
3 = Cyan
4 = Red
5 = Magenta
6 = Yellow/Brown
7 = White

To make blue background with bright yellow text the colour code would be:

    1*16 + 8 + 6 = 30

eg: M30,Yellow Menu
