SOFA: v1.60   Date: 03/01/1989
~Fixed: OFFSET label doesn't need the brackets around the label,
       eg OFFSET label is ok without the brackets.

SOFA: v1.61   Date: 08/01/1989
~Fixed: Added #ORG n command to change code origin say from 100h to 0.

SOFA: v1.62   Date: 05/02/1989
~Fixed: PUSH/POP to work with 'complex' opcodes when using ',' as a seperator.

SOFA: v1.63   Date: 11/03/1989
~Fixed: Tidied up some SOFA code and removed the SOFA maintenance BEEP option,
       this was only setup becase SOFA used to be a slowish compiler.

SOFA: v1.64   Date: 01/05/1989
~Fixed: Tiny fixups, speeded up compiler when handling registers.

SOFA: v1.65   Date: 07/06/1989
~Fixed: The message 'Warning! Undefined labels (0 used).' is now printed even
       when the warnings option has been turned off.
       This could have meant errors went undetected or programs behaved
       [even more] strangely.

SOFA: v1.66   Date: 20/06/1989
~Fixed: Added SOFA.CFG file, if its not found in the current directory then the

       the SOFA defaults.
