FAST - Fast PC Compiler
=======================

(c) Peter Campbell Software 1988-1994


Introduction
------------

Fast was written about 1986-1988 using assembly language.
Fast is loosely based on Basic, Pascal, C and Assembler.

The programs produced by Fast are very small and very fast.

Over the past 6 years many enhancements have been made (in the form of
increased speed, new commands and functions, more include files etc).

A new version should be available by mid-1995 which incorporates full
32 bit support, fast graphics and memory management + plus increased
optimisation for speed and program size.


Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started with Fast is to compile some of the 80+
example programs, run them then edit/view the source code.

Some of the main programs include:

DEMO.F is a simple demonstration program.
EDIT.F is a dos command line editor with popup window of last DOS commands.
FASTCHK.F is a disk/operating system check program.
FBMENU.F is a menu program, uses approx 10K memory.
FBSHOW.F is a file viewer (25*80, 50*80 and 60*132 characters).
LAND.F is an example game using the sprite library.
MIS.F is a simple tank missile game.
PCSOFT.F is a one finger type program, press one key at a time: alt/ctrl etc.
PU.F is a tsr popup for selecting printer functions.
PHONE.F is a terminal emulator with support for file transfer.
SPRITE.F is a sprite editor.
STICK.F is a communications package - connects to STICKR.
STICKR.F is the resident communications package - like carbon copy.
QSORT.F is a qsort program to sort large files.
WT.F is a multi-file editor with colour and many editing functions.

Aswell as Fast's extended commands and functions several include files
are here to increase the functionality:

    CMD_LINE	    - command line functions
    COLOUR	    - colour selection
    DATE24	    - 24 hour date fixer
    DISKC	    - disk caching
    EXTINPUT	    - extended keyboard input
    FAST32	    - 32 bit print routines
    FHELP	    - fast help files
    FINDBIN	    - binary searching
    FSORT	    - small file sorting
    KEYS	    - key routines for games
    MOUSE	    - mouse support (graphics and text)
    QSORT	    - quick sort for large files
    SAVER	    - screen saver
    SAVER2	    - screen saver (strange sentences)
    SAVER3	    - screen saver (strange sentences, rude)
    SPRITE	    - sprite routines
    STICK	    - stick communications library
    VGA 	    - vga routines (320*200 256 colours)
    XMS 	    - xms memory functions

You should find many of the example programs included very useful in their
own right - aswell as providing examples of how the Fast language is used.
