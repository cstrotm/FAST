Simply Shareware
3rd October 1994.

Dear Sir

I received a copy of your newsletter in the PC WORLD magazine today.
It has sparked up enough interest for me to submit my programs for your
evaluation and potential inclusion in the newsletter and availability to
your clients.

I have submitted shareware programs to overseas libraries (pc-sig, JCS and
several others). All companies have accepted the programs and over the
last few years I have had about 50 registered users (none from NZ).

I have enclosed some printed notes which are also included as .DOC files
in each of the relevant ZIP files.

I also have a company called The FastBase Developement Company Ltd. which
myself and two others setup once I had completed the FastBase 4GL.

Please evaluate these programs and provide me with any feedback.
Feel free to distribute these programs in your shareware library or by any
other means as you see fit.


The programs included (as detailed in the notes)

    STICK.ZIP	    - Carbon copy type program, uses less memory.
    FBMENU.ZIP	    - Menu program.
    FAST.ZIP	    - Fast compiler and 80+ example programs.
    SOFA.ZIP	    - Sofa assembler with source code.
    FBDEMO.ZIP	    - FastBase demonstration application (accounting).


I have several other programs which may be of use to others as shareware,
if you are interested I shall forward these to you with more thorough
and uptodate documentation.


Yours faithfully



Peter Campbell.
